              "57451  I am a customer with Wells Fargo Bank. Recently money was withdrawn on a couple of occasions without my permission or consent to pay for a timeshare account that was never used by me nor anyone connected to me because of unfair policies pertaining to the fees of the said timeshare. I tried cancelling the said timeshare account several times because of these fees that were never mentioned at the initiation. My account was debited to pay for the timeshare fees without my knowledge or consent several times. I tried correcting this with Wells Fargo bank with no avail. I would appreciate it if you can look into this matter for me. I was left with no funds in my account and as such I could not take care of the basic necessities of my day to day life. \\nThanks in advance,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ...
